# Prediction Mines Colombia

This repository contains the *Prediction Mines Colombia* project, which aims to predict the probable location of landmines in Colombia using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Description

Landmines pose a significant threat in various regions of Colombia. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify high-risk areas, optimizing humanitarian demining efforts.
